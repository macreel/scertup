                        Education provides a vital clue to the teaching–learning processes that should take place
                        within and beyond classrooms. A proper education sets people to grow personally,
                        professionally, and socially. It can awaken joy, curiosity, and deep desire to pursue leadership
                        roles and positively impact those around you.

                        Dear friends and colleagues at SCERT, it gives me immense pleasure to work as the Director of SCERT,
                        surrounded by a team of passionate and dedicated teacher educators. Together, we are influencing
                        the lives of many by shaping education in this rapidly changing scenario, bringing policy decisions
                        to life, and impacting the quality of education.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Teacher training is one of the significant components of SCERT/DIETs. I am confident that effective, 
                        need-based training designs will be developed at the state and district levels for academic and 
                        professional capacity building, including running short-term courses throughout the year. The National 
                        Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the importance of overhauling the service environment and culture 
                        of schools to maximize the effectiveness of teachers.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Research proves that teacher quality is the most important school-related factor influencing student 
                        achievement. The teacher preparation process requires a paradigm shift in training mechanisms. Experiential 
                        learning, arts-integrated, and sports-integrated pedagogies, alongside formative and adaptive assessment 
                        techniques, are crucial for achieving this.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        I can visualize the bigger role that SCERT and DIETs have to play in implementing the provisions of NEP 2020 
                        with other stakeholders and academic bodies. This milestone can be achieved with team effort, motivation, 
                        and the immense potential within our organization.
